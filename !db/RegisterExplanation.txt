Explanation:

	HashPassword Method:
	 Uses SHA-256 to hash the password before storing it in the database.
	 This is important for security reasons to ensure passwords are not stored in plain text.
	 RegisterUser Method:

	 Establishes a connection to the database using a connection string.
	 Executes an INSERT SQL command to add the new user to the Users table.
	 Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

	Event Handler:
	 The btnRegister_Click method gathers input from the text boxes, hashes the password, and calls RegisterUser to insert the user data into the database.

	Summary:
	 Create a Users table in your database to store user information.
	 Hash passwords before storing them for security.
	 Use parameterized SQL commands to insert user data into the database safely.
	 Handle user input validation to ensure all fields are filled out.
